# StashUniversalPerformerSearch.user.js

Empornium, Bunkr, SimpCity (prefill + focus), and Coomer (with OnlyFans/Fansly username detection) performer search for Stash. Handles SPA + hard-refresh fallback and a minimal settings panel.

- There are times where you must do a CTRL-F5 refresh to get the script to load. Not sure why.

- This is not perfect but works reasonably well.

- With Simpcity you have to hit Enter or click Search on the page to activate the search.

- You obviously need accounts for Empornium and Simpcity. This does not get around that.

- You might want to make the @match more specific to your stash install to keep it from matching on other sites.

- If you want to add a site, let me know, or do a pull request.
